Run pacman.exe for the game.

The game has 2, albeit similar, levels.

The movement is "joystick" - based. For example, if you want to go up, start pressing the up arrow before the corner.
Same for other directions.
If you get stuck, press up/down or left/right a bit (based on how the pacman is oriented) and it will work.
